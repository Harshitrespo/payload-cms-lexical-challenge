# Payload CMS Lexical Challenge

This project implements a custom Mark (Highlight) feature for Payload CMS's Lexical editor as part of a coding challenge. The template comes configured with the bare minimum to get started plus our custom highlighting functionality.

## Custom Mark (Highlight) Feature Implementation

This project includes a fully functional custom Mark/Highlight feature for the Payload CMS Lexical editor with the following capabilities:

### Features Implemented

- **Custom Toolbar Button**: FontAwesome highlighter icon positioned between strikethrough and subscript buttons
- **Text Highlighting**: Highlights selected text with Material Design Yellow **(#ffeb3b)** background and black text for readability
- **Active State Detection**: Comprehensive detection of highlighted text including:
  - Lexical node inline styles
  - DOM element computed and inline styles
  - Parent element traversal for nested highlighting
  - Support for double-click text selection
- **Toggle Functionality**: Click to highlight, click again to remove highlighting
- **HTML Serialization**: Properly serializes to `<mark>` HTML tags
- **Selection Preservation**: Maintains text selection after toggling highlight state
- **Event Handling**: Multiple event listeners for selection changes, mouse events, and double-click support
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses React useCallback for event handlers and proper cleanup

### Technical Implementation

#### File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ constant.ts                           # Shared highlight color constants
â”œâ”€â”€ collections/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Posts.ts                         # Collection config with MarkFeature
â””â”€â”€ lexical/
    â”œâ”€â”€ features/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mark.client.tsx              # Client-side feature configuration
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ markFeature.server.ts        # Server-side feature configuration
    â”œâ”€â”€ nodes/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MarkNode.ts                  # Custom Lexical node extending TextNode
    â””â”€â”€ plugins/
        â””â”€â”€ MarkToolbarButton.tsx        # React toolbar button component
```

#### Key Components

1. **MarkNode.ts**: Custom Lexical TextNode that handles DOM creation, updates, and HTML serialization
2. **MarkToolbarButton.tsx**: React component with comprehensive active state detection and toggle functionality
3. **mark.client.tsx**: Client-side feature configuration with toolbar integration
4. **markFeature.server.ts**: Server-side feature registration
5. **Posts.ts**: Collection configuration integrating the MarkFeature with default Payload features

### Usage

1. Select any text in the Lexical editor
2. Click the highlighter button in the toolbar (between strikethrough and subscript)
3. Text will be highlighted with yellow background
4. Click the button again to remove highlighting

### Custom Footnote Feature

This step involved replacing the default `subscript` and `superscript` features with a new, custom "Footnote" feature.

### Feature Requirements & Implementation

1.  **Footnote Button**:

    - The default `subscript` and `superscript` toolbar buttons were removed.
    - A new "Footnote" button was added to the toolbar.

2.  **Footnote Creation Modal**:

    - Clicking the footnote button opens a modal to add or edit footnote content.
    - The modal contains a limited rich-text editor that allows only **bold**, **italic**, **strikethrough**, and **link** formatting. Paragraphs are supported as the default text block.
    - Links created within the footnote automatically open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) for a better user experience.

3.  **In-Editor Experience**:
    - When a footnote is added, a numbered marker appears in the main editor.
    - Hovering over this marker reveals a small, non-editable popup that previews the rich-text content of the footnote.
    - The hover popup contains "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to manage the footnote.

### Technical Implementation

The feature was built using a combination of Lexical editor plugins, custom nodes, and global state management to overcome challenges with editor event handling:

- **Global State for Modal**: A global state management solution (`valtio`) was used to manage the footnote modal's state (open/closed, content). This decoupled the modal from the toolbar, preventing it from closing unexpectedly due to editor re-renders.
- **Custom Lexical Nodes**:
  - `FootnoteNode`: A custom inline node was created to represent the footnote marker in the editor state.
  - `CustomLinkNode`: To meet the requirement of links opening in a new tab, the default `LinkNode` was extended to enforce `target="_blank"`.
- **Custom Plugins**:
  - `FootnotePopupPlugin`: This plugin listens for hover events on footnote markers and renders the preview popup.
  - `FootnoteModal`: A standalone React component that contains the rich-text editor for footnote content and is controlled by the global store.
